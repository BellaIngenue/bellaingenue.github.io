# Small HTML/CSS Game
A small HTML/CSS/JS Game I made in 2023 based on a story I wrote one night for my friends. Want to play? Feel free to play using the button below. 

<button id="playbutton" onclick="window.location.href='/docs/games/gchildren/yourjourney/yourjourney.html';">ðŸ’™Interested in playing my game? Click here!ðŸ’™</button>

## Want to Read the Story?
There was an original story that went along this game. I wrote it in March 2023 and revamped it later that year. If you're curious, feel free to head [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gHJSS_0pU0xngm1KhSMeHbvJr3k66wlhQr8bzEWA6uk/edit?usp=sharing) to read more!


## Having Issues?
There is no other thing you need to do. As it is HTML based there should be no complications. Do note, it's an incredibly small and unfinished game. I was too uninterested to ever continue sadly.

If there are any other issues, or complications, please alert me [here](mailto:sienasrivera@gmail.com). Thank you for your interest!!
