# Siena R | Github Portfolio and Website
Hi there! My name is Siena, I'm a Cognitive Science graduate from UC San Diego. I recently graduated in March 2024 with my Bachelor's of Science.

## Simple Github Portfolio for Games
Welcome to my Github Portfolio and where I will publish my work and projects that I can not host on Github. The main features in this section are based off games I have made (two visual novels). One made with Adobe Flash, and the other with a application known as Twine.

## Some of the Games I've made:
- [Adobe Macromedia Flash Gameüåû](https://bellaingenue.github.io/docs/games/gchildren/flashgame/flashgame.html): A very old Flash game made in the 2010s
- [Your Journeyü§ç](https://bellaingenue.github.io/docs/games/gchildren/yourjourney/yourjourney.html): A simple game made with Twine
