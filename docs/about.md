## About Me!
Hello, Github explorer! Welcome to my little corner of the digital universe! I hope you enjoy your stay! Let me tell you a little bit about me. I'm a cognitive science enthusiast with a zest for life and a passion for understanding how humans and machines mingle and dance in the realms of information processing.

I'm a curious mind with a Bachelor's degree in Cognitive Science from UCSD, equipped with the power of mathematics and programming, and adorned with certifications in Java and OOP.

So, what's next on this wild cognitive journey, you ask? Well, I'm setting my sights on the research frontier, eager to dive into the depths of cognitive science and contribute my spark to the blaze of innovation. Let's collaborate, learn, and push the boundaries of what's possible together! Because hey, with a little curiosity and a lot of passion, who knows what incredible discoveries await?

But along the way, I took a stop at a Biotech company to work on my Laboratory experience! It was an amazing opportunity, but so shortly lived, as our Lab closed and I had to continue on my way. The BSL-Lab experience was one-of-a-kind and I will never forget the fun, but chaotic times, that were lived there.

My next stop is at a Dermatology Research Center. A bit more up my alley, you could say! While there's a lot of differences from my previous position and this one, I still enjoy the work environment. Learning, growing, and being able to constantly be around new and exciting people really makes my day.

Join me on this adventure, won't you? Let's make some waves in the world of cognitive science and have a little fun along the way!

## My Mission Here
I am a dynamic cognitive science graduate with a vibrant personality and a fervent desire to inspire and empower others. Armed with a strong academic background in understanding human behavior and cognition, I possess analytical prowess and a natural ability to connect with people. My boundless enthusiasm and genuine commitment to helping others make me a compelling catalyst for transformation, poised to inspire and uplift individuals and communities worldwide!

I want to change the world. Whether that be in the most miniscule manner, in my own life, or in a traumatic and large way. I have ambition, and strength, and I want to see my efforts evolve.

Come with me on this adventure, and let us get to know each other better!!
