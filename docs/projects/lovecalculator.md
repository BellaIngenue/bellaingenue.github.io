# Silly Love Calculator
This was a silly project I worked on with my Partner, and we both created a unique version of a Love Calculator! It is NOT Randomized, and rather uses "logic" to calculate the compatibility of the couple/two people!

## Information about this code
This is a simple Calculator  HTML, CSS, JS project that was made using CodePen ❤️ 

This was originally a Java project I created and recompiled into JS. It's really silly, not to be taken seriously, and I just wanted something cute to add to my Portfolio!

## Source Code:
