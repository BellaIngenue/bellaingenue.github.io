# Siena R | Github Portfolio and Website
Hi there! My name is Siena, I'm a Cognitive Science graduate from UC San Diego. I graduated in March 2024 with my Bachelor's of Science.

## Simple Github Portfolio for Fun Projects
Welcome to my Github Portfolio and where I will publish my work and projects that I can not host on Github. There are many projects I have included in this website. 

## Some of the Projects and Work:
- [Discord MAIL📫](https://bellaingenue.github.io/docs/projects/pchildren/discordmail/): Discord Webhook that connects Gmail to Discord
- [Voice Generator🗣️](https://bellaingenue.github.io/docs/projects/pchildren/voicegenerator/): A silly project I made for a future Video Game that uses my voice to make "Undertale"-inspired voice lines!
- [Personality Test🔋](https://bellaingenue.github.io/docs/projects/pchildren/personalitytest/): This simple personality test is based off your SOCIAL Extroversion or Introversion. In addition, it will look into if you’re an Ambivert, or how much of an Extrovert or Introvert you are
- [Clock Calculator🕰️](https://bellaingenue.github.io/docs/projects/pchildren/clockcalculator/): Ever had a boss that would not allow you to ever clock out late? Well, here’s a really useless website built using HTML, CSS and JS
- [Art Portfolio Information🎨](https://www.sienasrivera.website/personal-projects/angeldemon-artwork): More Information on my Art Portfolio can be found here!
- [MISC Projects🌧️](https://www.sienasrivera.website/personal-projects): BlueSkies Minecraft, Google Sites, Other Small Games
