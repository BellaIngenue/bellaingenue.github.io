# Voice Generator
Voice Generator is a simple CLI generator of the sound system used for dialogues in games like Celeste and Undertale! But I managed to bring it over to its own webpage on here for anyone to use on Github Pages! (Not able to completely implement yet on Github Pages)

But in case you want to download it and do it local, download the code from my Github here:

[Voice Generator üó£Ô∏è](https://github.com/BellaIngenue/Voice-Generator): Github Project Link

{: .important }

- Python 3.10: Make sure you have the CORRECT Version, as Audioop no longer works with any others higher than 3.10.
[Download 3.10 here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/): Download
  - Make sure to add it in the Environmental PATH
- Pip Installer: Makes life easier
- Pydub: Handles loading, editing, and exporting audio
- Ffmpeg OR Libav: For non-WAV files like MP3
  - If you‚Äôre only working with .wav, you don‚Äôt need FFmpeg ‚Äî pydub works with raw .wav files out of the box.
- SimpleAudio: Live Playback (if desired)
