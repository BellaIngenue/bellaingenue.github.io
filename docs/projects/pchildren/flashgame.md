# Small Flash Game
A small Flash Game (swf) I made in the latter 2010s.  Want to play? Feel free to play using the button below. 


{: .important }
It uses Ruffle, a Chrome Extension that allows you to play Flash Games in your browser! This means you MUST have the Chrome extension to be able to play this game. Click [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ruffle-flash-emulator/donbcfbmhbcapadipfkeojnmajbakjdc) for a link to the Chrome Extension!! 

<button id="playbutton" onclick="window.location.href='/docs/projects/pchildren/flashgamestuff/game.html';">ü§çInterested in playing my game? Click here!ü§ç</button>


## Having Issues?

 Please download the Ruffle Chrome Extension if you run into any complications in running the game itself. Do note, it's an incredibly small and unfinished game. I lost all the assets and was too uninterested to ever start over. 

If there are any other issues, or complications, please alert me [here](mailto:sienasrivera@gmail.com). Thank you for your interest!!
