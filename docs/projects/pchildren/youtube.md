# My New and Improved Silly Youtube Channel
While not quite related to coding or programming, I did want to have a space to share and possibly archive my Youtube Channel content! I started a new channel known as "BellaIngenue" or "Pretty Innocent" in 2025 and want to share it with anyone reading!

{: .important }
Obligatory warning that this Youtube Channel is a GAMING-focused channel that is not always appropriate for work environments. Regardless, I do like showing what I can do and how I can make my life more fun, and light.
