# Discord Mail
A small webhook that connects Gmail (only Gmail) to Discord. This uses the Google Apps Scripts and Google Analytics. 

{: .note }
To use this bot, make sure to first make a webhook in the server you are connecting to. This could be in any channel, as long as you have access to it (and the webhooks themselves). I would recommend only using this webhook if you know that it is safe to use. NEVER share the webhook keys with anyone. 


## Information about the Project
### Steps To Reproduce:
1. Create a Webhook in your Discord Server
	2. Go to Settings -> Integrations -> Webhooks
![Webhook Integration](/assets/images/image1.PNG)
	3. View Webhooks -> New Webhooks
![New Webhook](/assets/images/image2.PNG)
	4. Select a Channel from your Server, and then Copy Webhook URL (this is important)
![Copy Webhook URL](/assets/images/image3.PNG)
2. Go to [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/home)
	3. Click on Create a New Project -> Name it whatever you want
![Create a New Project](/assets/images/image4.PNG)
	4. Click on the Cog Icon to to to Project Settings
![Project Settings](/assets/images/image5.PNG)
	5. Scroll down to Script Properties -> Add Script Property
![Add Script Property](/assets/images/image6.PNG)
	6. Add two Properties -> TOKEN and WEBHOOKS (spell it the same way)
![TOKEN and WEBHOOKS](/assets/images/image7.PNG)
3. Click on the Clock to Setup Triggers (we only need 1, even for 2 functions)
	4. Click Add Trigger
![Add Trigger](/assets/images/image8.PNG)
	5. Make it look the exact same as this image below... (Or change the time if applicable)
![Edit Trigger](/assets/images/image9.PNG)
4. CODING TIME!!!!!! Please refer to the code below...
	5. Paste your channel in `const channel= 'ðŸ“«mail';` 
	6. Notice `const checkSpan = 60;` 
		7. That entails that every 60 minutes, the command sendMailsToDiscord() will be run
		8. I would not advise doing any sooner than that, as your email quota may run out. (100/day for free users)

# Coding Time!!!!
