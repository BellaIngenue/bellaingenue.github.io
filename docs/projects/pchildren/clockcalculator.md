# Simple Clock-In Clock-Out Calculator
Ever had a boss that would not allow you to ever clock out late? Well, here's a really useless website built using HTML, CSS and JS to allow yourself to prioritize time while also looking efficient and cute!

You do need to make sure you have at least IN DAY, OUT LUNCH and Time allowed for Lunch inputted or the errors will show! Thanks for using my very useless website üòÅ

I have an Excel Version of the code available that is much more intuitive and easier to use. BUT for SCIENCE I wanted to make an actual website GUI version.

## Information about this code
This is a simple Calculator  HTML, CSS, JS project that was made using CodePen ‚ù§Ô∏è

### Want to try the Calculator?
<button id="playbutton" onclick="window.location.href='/docs/projects/pchildren/clock/clock.html';">üíõInterested in trying my Calculator? Click here!üíõ</button>

## Have any questions, comments, or concerns?
Feel free to reach out anytime or open a ticket with me to communicate if there's any problems and/or errors!
