# Simple Personality Test
This small and simple personality assessment was more of a "Test" than an actual project. I have always been interested in things like Personality and Cognitive Processes that circulate in our brains. Personality tests are something that have a long history, however are usually referred as "Non-Clinically Significant" and are more for fun and educational purposes.

{: .warning }
There is not much of a warning to the test itself, but more of a warning that this is a basic assessment and has no hold on any personality or typology system that exists.

## Information about this Personality Test
This simple personality test is based off your SOCIAL Extroversion or Introversion. In addition, it will look into if you're an Ambivert, or how much of an Extrovert or Introvert you are. This test does not account COGNITIVE Extroversion or Introversion, just the SOCIAL interpretation.
