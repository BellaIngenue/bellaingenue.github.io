# Siena R | Github Portfolio and Website
Hi there! My name is Siena, I'm a Cognitive Science graduate from UC San Diego. I graduated in March 2024 with my Bachelor's of Science.

## Simple Github Portfolio for Data Projects
Welcome to my Github Portfolio and where I will publish my work and projects that I can not host on Github. There are many projects I have included in this website. 

## Some of the Notable Data Projects:
- [Typology & Mental Health](https://github.com/BellaIngenue/TypologyAndMentalHealth): A Python + Jupyter Notebooks Data Project looking at Mental Health disorders and their correlation/causation to MBTI Types
- [Divorce Rates & Big 5/OCEAN](https://github.com/BellaIngenue/Divorce_Rates_And_Big_5): There are TWO projects: 1 using MATLab and the other using Python + Jupyter Notebooks. Both looking at correlations between Divorce Rates and the corresponding individuals with differnet OCEAN/Big 5 types
- [COGS 108 Data Science Project](https://bellaingenue.github.io/docs/schoolwork/schildren/cogs108/): This Project was dedicated to COGS 108: Data Science in Practice. It is a course held for Undergraduates at UCSD
