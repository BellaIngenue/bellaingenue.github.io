# Siena R | Github Portfolio and Website
Hi there! My name is Siena, I'm a Cognitive Science graduate from UC San Diego. I recently graduated in March 2024 with my Bachelor's of Science.

## Simple Github Portfolio for School Work
Welcome to my Github Portfolio and where I will publish my work and projects that I can not host on Github. There are many school-based projects I have done and been a part of over the years, so I am also including those in this section!!

## Some of the Projects and Work:
- [COGS108: UCSD](https://github.com/BellaIngenue/SienaRivera_COGS108): A School Project done and published using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Surrounded the idea of COVID 19 and the connection/association with Air Quality in California
- [EDS 124BR: UCSD](https://www.sienasrivera.website/school-portfolio/ucsd-eds-124br-course): A collection of videos and media made throughout my Education Studies course at UC San Diego
- [Multi-Identity Art: UCSD](https://sites.google.com/view/miacucsd/): A simple website made for the school club (MIAC) I was with while studying my Bachelor's of Science at UC San Diego
