## Siena R | Github Portfolio and Website
Hi there! My name is Siena, I'm a Cognitive Science graduate from UC San Diego. I graduated in March 2024 with my Bachelor's of Science in Cognitive Science w/ a Specialization in Clinical Aspects of Cognition. And since then I have worked a few Full-Time Positions! I am currently working on getting a Certification in Biostatistics!

### Simple Github Portfolio for Work and Projects
Welcome to my Github Portfolio and where I will publish my work and projects that I can not host on Github. There are many projects I have included in this website. I have moved some of the projects around... Now we have a dedicated Data Projects Section, Fun Projects Section, School Work Section and a Games Section! 

### Some of the Projects and Work
- [Voice Generator🗣️](https://bellaingenue.github.io/docs/projects/pchildren/voicegenerator/): A silly project I made for a future Video Game that uses my voice to make "Undertale"-inspired voice lines!
- [Discord MAIL📫](https://bellaingenue.github.io/docs/projects/pchildren/discordmail/): Discord Webhook that connects Gmail to Discord
- [Data Projects 📊](https://bellaingenue.github.io/docs/data/data/): Some of the Data Projects I have done since Graduating! Mostly for fun, but there were some projects I am really proud of! Newest is a project I had first done in a 2019 course and since re-compiled in both Python and R!!
- [Adobe Macromedia Flash Game🌞](https://bellaingenue.github.io/docs/projects/pchildren/flashgame/flashgame.html): A very old Flash game made in the 2010s
- [Your Journey🤍](https://bellaingenue.github.io/docs/projects/pchildren/yourjourney/yourjourney.html): A simple game made with Twine
- MISC Projects: BlueSkies Minecraft, Google Sites, Other Small Games
