# Siena R | Github Portfolio and Website
Hi there! My name is Siena Rivera, I'm a Cognitive Science Graduate from UC San Diego. I  graduated in March 2024 with my Bachelor's of Science.

I'm currently working as a Research Assistant at a local Dermatology Research Center here near my Alma Matar. While not completely related to my coding and programming parts, this career will help me in my future goals and aspirations!
